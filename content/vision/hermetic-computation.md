Hermetic Computation
====================

Container technology is a key part of our approach to reliability:
containers makes it *possible* to have a *zero-ambiguity environment*,
where all the inputs necessary to make a process run are absolutely clear.

- *Variation builds on precision*: the Timeless Stack designs for systems like automatic
  updates and matrix tests on environmental variations by building them *on top*
  of the zero-ambiguity/deep-time-reproducible API layer of Formulas.
  This allows clear identification of each version/test/etc, making it possible to
  clearly report what's been covered and what needs to be finished.
