Keeping in Touch
=====

If you'd like to follow the Timeless project and get occasional email about releases and development milestones:

- Follow the [Timeless project repo](https://github.com/polydawn/timeless/) on Github: new releases are periodically published here, with changelogs.
- We have an (extremely) low-volume mailing list for announcements: [timeless-stack-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/timeless-stack-announce)

If you'd like to discuss development, ask questions, or just lurk the community:

- Feel free to grab the email address from git commit messages and get in touch directly, or
- We have a community mailing list that anyone may join: [timeless-stack@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/timeless-stack)
- If the mailing list is quiet, it's because most of the core team is on [Matrix](https://matrix.org); ask for more info.
