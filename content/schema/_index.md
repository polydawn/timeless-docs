# Schema Reference

Each layer of the Timeless Stack is defined by serializable APIs and
captured in a schema.

Each layer has its own schema documentation.
Layers may refer to types from the layers below them (but not above).

See the [Design](/design) chapter for an introduction to the Layer model,
if the layers are not already familiar.

The [Schema Implementations](./implementations) page contains links to
language-specific implementations and their docs,
which in some cases may be more complete.
